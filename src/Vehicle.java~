//Create an abstract base class called Vehicle that has the following attributes:
//brand (type String): the brand of the vehicle.
//model (type String): the model of the vehicle.
//year (type int): the year of manufacture of the vehicle.

//It must implement the Movable interface but leave the move() method as abstract so that derived classes implement it.
//The Vehicle class should also have a method called showInfo() that prints the brand, model, and year of the vehicle.
